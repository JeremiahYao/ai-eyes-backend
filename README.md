- Estimate distance using stereo vision
- Provide safe navigation feedback
- Integrate with Google Maps for directions

## Development Approach
- Backend logic is designed and tested online using Google Colab
- Code is version-controlled using GitHub
- Final deployment will be done on a stronger CPU/GPU system

## Security
